     <p>Hello! I am Nishika, a passionate web development student with a strong interest in coding and creating innovative projects. I enjoy learning new technologies, improving my skills, and applying them to build efficient and user-friendly web solutions. I am dedicated, detail-oriented, and constantly seeking opportunities to grow as a developer while contributing to meaningful and impactful projects.".</p>

     <p>My learning approach is hands-on and self-driven. I constantly challenge myself with new coding problems, online courses, and small projects to improve my technical skills. This approach has helped me develop proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks, allowing me to build responsive and user-friendly web applications.</p>

     <p>Beyond coding, I am deeply interested in problem-solving and creative design. I strive to create projects that are not only functional but also visually appealing and intuitive for users. Attention to detail and a focus on user experience are central to the way I develop my projects.</p>

     <p>Looking ahead, I am eager to further enhance my skills and take on challenging projects that allow me to contribute meaningfully to the tech community. I am committed to growing as a developer and leveraging my creativity and technical expertise to build impactful web solutions.</p>
